\arguments{
\item{project}{A data frame. See `ganttrify::test_project` for an example.}

\item{spots}{A data frame. See `ganttrify::test_spots` for an example.}

\item{by_date}{Logical, defaults to FALSE If FALSE, the the start and end
columns in the data frame should correspond to month numbers from the
beginning of the project. If TRUE, dates in the format ("2020-10" or
"2020-10-01") should be given.}

\item{exact_date}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. If FALSE, then periods are
always understood to include full months. If FALSE, then exact dates can be
given.}

\item{project_start_date}{The date when the project starts. It can be a date,
or a string in the format "2020-03" or "2020-03-01". Ignored if
`month_number_date` is set to FALSE.}

\item{colour_palette}{A character vector of colours or a colour palette. If
necessary, colours are recycled as needed. Defaults to
`wesanderson::wes_palette("Darjeeling1")`. For more palettes, consider also
the `MetBrewer` package, e.g. `colour_palette =
MetBrewer::met.brewer("Lakota")`. Colours can be passed as a vector of hex
codes (e.g. `colour_palette = c("#6ACCEA", "#00FFB8", "#B90000",
"#6C919C")`)}

\item{font_family}{A character vector of length 1, defaults to "sans". It is
recommended to use a narrow/condensed font such as Roboto Condensed for
more efficient use of text space.}

\item{mark_quarters}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, vertical lines are
added in correspondence of change of quarter (end of March, end of June,
end of September, end of December).}

\item{mark_years}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, vertical lines are
added in correspondence of change of year (1 January).}

\item{size_wp}{Numeric, defaults to 6. It defines the thickness of the line
used to represent WPs.}

\item{hide_wp}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, the lines of the WP are
hidden and only activities are shown.}

\item{wp_label_bold}{Logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the
label for working packages is set to bold face, while activities remain
plain. Set to \code{FALSE} to keep have all labels in plain face or for
further customisation (`ganttrify` offers basic markdown support).}

\item{size_activity}{Numeric, defaults to 4. It defines the thickness of the
line used to represent activities.}

\item{hide_activity}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, the lines of
activities are hidden and only activities are shown.}

\item{size_text_relative}{Numeric, defaults to 1. Changes the size of all
textual elements relative to their default size. If you set this to e.g.
1.5 all text elements will be 50\% bigger.}

\item{label_wrap}{Defaults to FALSE. If given, must be numeric, referring to
the number of characters per line allowed in the labels of projects and
activities, or logical (if set to TRUE, it will default to 32). To be used
when labels would otherwise be excessively long.}

\item{month_number_label}{Logical, defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, it includes
month numbering on x axis.}

\item{month_label_string}{Defaults to "M", relevant only if
`month_number_label` is set to \code{TRUE}. String that precedes the month
number: e.g. if set to "M", then months are labeled as "M1", "M2", etc.}

\item{month_date_label}{Logical, defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, it includes month
names and dates on the x axis.}

\item{x_axis_position}{Logical, defaults to "top". Can also be "bottom". Used
only when only one of `month_number_label` and `month_date_label` is TRUE,
otherwise ignored.}

\item{colour_stripe}{Character, defaults to "lightgray". This is the stripe
colour in the background used in alternate months.}

\item{alpha_wp}{Numeric, defaults to 1. Controls transparency of the line
used to represent WPs.}

\item{alpha_activity}{Numeric, defaults to 1. Controls transparency of the
line used to represent activities.}

\item{line_end}{Character, defaults to NULL. If given, takes precedence over
`line_end_wp` and `line_end_activity` and applies the value to both. One of
"round", "butt", "square". Controls line ends.}

\item{line_end_wp}{Character, defaults to "round". One of "round", "butt",
"square". Controls line ends.}

\item{line_end_activity}{Character, defaults to "butt". One of "round",
"butt", "square". Controls line ends.}

\item{spot_padding}{Unit, defaults to `ggplot2::unit(0.2, "lines")`. If you
use spot events, this is the padding around the text. Smaller value are
best for busy gantt charts; if you have lots of space or use larger font
sizes you may want to increase this value.}

\item{spot_fill}{Defaults to `ggplot2::alpha(c("white"), 1)`. This is the
background fill colour of spot events. By default, it is set to solid
white. If you want to add some transparency to enable visual continuity of
the underlying lines, adjust the transparency value to your taste adapting
the function used by default.}

\item{spot_text_colour}{Defaults to "grey20", for a dark but not quite black
text.}

\item{spot_size_text_relative}{Defaults to 1. This is combined with
`size_text_relative`.}

\item{spot_fontface}{Defaults to "bold". Available values are "plain",
"bold", "italic" and "bold.italic".}

\item{spot_border}{Defaults to 0.25. Internally passed as `label.size` to
`geom_label()`.  Set to 0 or NA to remove the border.}

\item{month_breaks}{Numeric, defaults to 1. It defines if labels for all
months are shown or only once every x months. Useful for longer projects.}

\item{show_vertical_lines}{Logical, defaults to TRUE. If set to FALSE, it
hides the thin vertical lines corresponding to month numbers. Useful in
particular for longer projects.}

\item{axis_text_align}{Character, defaults to "right". Defines alignment of
text on the y-axis is left. Accepted values are "left", "right", "centre",
or "center".}
